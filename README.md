# 2d_xy
Monte Carlo simulations of 2D XY model on GPGPU with CUDA

Compilers needed nvcc for CUDA C and PGI Fortran compilers for CUDA Fortran

This utilizes a pre existing code for generating random numbers directly on 
the GPU written in CUDA C to perform Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D XY model 
written in CUDA Fortran.
